          Without any sugar. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?
          George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What
          are you writing? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your
          kids are gonna love it. Uh, Doc. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't
          wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? Its good. Jesus. Perfect,
          just perfect. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine
          into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless,
          steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Science Fiction
          Theater. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they
          don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say,
          'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think
          I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like
          my old man. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?
          No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're
          strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car,
          you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. Oh Mom,
          there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
